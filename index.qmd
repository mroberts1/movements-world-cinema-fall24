## Overview

This course examines the historical development of so-called “art” cinemas from the 1950s to the present, focusing on the work of filmmakers from Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Key topics include the filmmaker as auteur, the historical relationship between Hollywood and other national film industries, the impact of international arthouse cinema on U.S. film culture after the break-up of the studio system, and the role of contemporary film festivals and film critics in the circulation of a canon of international auteurs and national cinemas. Particular emphasis is given to the historical impact of processes of globalization on cinema and the emergence of an increasingly cosmopolitan film culture.

## Format

This is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.

**Course Texts**

Paul Schrader, *Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer*. Oakland: University of California Press, 2018.

Andrei Tarkovsky, *Sculpting in Time*. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1989.

Other course readings will mostly be distributed as PDFs via Canvas or online.
