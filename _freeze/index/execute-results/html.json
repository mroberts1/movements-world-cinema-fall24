Key topics include the filmmaker as auteur, the historical relationship between Hollywood and other national film industries, the impact of international arthouse cinema on U.S. film culture after the break-up of the studio system, and the role of contemporary film festivals and film critics in the circulation of a canon of international auteurs and national cinemas. Particular emphasis is given to the historical impact of processes of globalization on cinema and the emergence of an increasingly cosmopolitan film culture.\n\n## Format\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\n-   have acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\n-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\n-   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\n-   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n**Readings**\n\nCourse readings will mostly be distributed as PDFs via Canvas or online. Recommended texts are listed below. \\[I\\] = Iwasaki Library\n\nJohn Hill and Pamela Church Gibson, eds., *World Cinema: Critical Approaches*.

The model will be any review essay from a magazine/journal such as Film Comment or Sight and Sound. There are four possible submission deadlines, so you are allowed to skip any two of these.\n\n**World Film Locations (20%)**\n\nRead any one of the University of Chicago’s World Film Locations books about global film cities (other than from North American cities). Prepare a short guide to the book (3-4 pages) summarizing key information from it: recommended directors, films, online resources, etc. Present this with relevant clips in a 20-30 minute class presentation.\n\n**Research Paper/Project (25% + 15% presentation)**\n\nWrite a 10-12 page paper, including bibliography, on a topic of your choice relevant to the course. This could be a study of a set of films by a specific auteur, a detailed study of a global film location. This project will be presented in class, with clips, during the last two classes of the semester.\n\nYou may also present your project in Video Essay format (max. 10 minutes), but are responsible for all production aspects of the project. Pair work is possible, but each student will receive the same final grade.\n\n**Deadlines & Extensions**\n\nPapers submitted after deadline will be penalized unless an extension has been approved beforehand. Extensions must be requested by email before the deadline in question, and will not be granted solely on the basis of workload. Late papers will not be accepted more than one week after deadline.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nAttendance of all scheduled class sessions is mandatory. Excused absences include illness, family emergency, or job interview, and must be requested during the week of the class missed. Be sure to follow up about announcements missed. A total of **four** unexcused absences will result in a failing grade.\n\n**Participation**\n\nIt is essential that you come to class prepared and with something to say about what you have been reading or watching. Keep comments on-topic and allow others their turn to speak. As far as possible, approach discussions with an open mind: be attentive to what other group members are saying and respect ideas or world- views which differ from your own.\n\n### Weekly Schedule\n\n09/05 **Introduction: Locating World Cinema**\n\nL’Assenza (dir.
