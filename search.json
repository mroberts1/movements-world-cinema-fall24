Key topics include the filmmaker as auteur, the historical relationship between Hollywood and other national film industries, the impact of international arthouse cinema on U.S. film culture after the break-up of the studio system, and the role of contemporary film festivals and film critics in the circulation of a canon of international auteurs and national cinemas. Particular emphasis is given to the historical impact of processes of globalization on cinema and the emergence of an increasingly cosmopolitan film culture.\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\nCourse Texts\nPaul Schrader, Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer. Oakland: University of California Press, 2018.\nAndrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1989.\nOther course readings will mostly be distributed as PDFs via Canvas or online.\nOnline Resources\n\nUnseen Cinema, by Benoît Rouilly, about what he calls Contemporary Contemplative Cinema (CCC)\nCinemaWaves, a current attemtpt to document global film movements of the past century.\nSee also Rouilly’s second blog, SCREENVILLE\n\nPlease add these sites to the Bookmarks toolbar of your browser, as you will be referencing them regularly.\nEvaluation\nResearch paper/project (10-12 pages): 25%\nResearch paper/project presentation: 15%\nFilm Movements: in-class presentation: 10%\nFilm Movements: short paper: 15%\nParticipation (includes attendance, punctuality, active participation in class discussion): 10%\nAssignments\nFilm Movements (50%)\nSelect any film movement from the CinemaWaves list Present this with relevant clips in a 20-30 minute class presentation.\nResearch Paper/Project (25% + 15% presentation)\nWrite a 10-12 page paper, including bibliography, on a topic of your choice relevant to the course.
